at `.github/workflows/ai-pr-reviewer.yml`

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request:
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: vest-ai-pr-reviewer@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        with:
          debug: false
          review_simple_changes: false
          review_comment_lgtm: false
```

### Environment variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This should already be available to the GitHub Action
  environment. This is used to add comments to the pull request.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: use this to authenticate with Anthropic's Claude API. You can get one
  [here](https://console.anthropic.com/). Please add this key to your GitHub Action secrets.

### Models: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Haiku

We recommend using Claude 3.5 Haiku for lighter tasks such as summarizing the
changes (`openai_light_model` in configuration) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for more complex
review and commenting tasks (`openai_heavy_model` in configuration).

### Prompts & Configuration

See: [action.yml](./action.yml)

Tip: You can change the bot personality by configuring the `system_message`
value. For example, to review docs/blog posts, you can use the following prompt:

<details>
<summary>Blog Reviewer Prompt</summary>

```yaml
system_message: |
  You are `@vest-ai` (aka `github-actions[bot]`), a language model
  trained by Anthropic. Your purpose is to act as a highly experienced
  DevRel (developer relations) professional with focus on cloud-native
  infrastructure.

  Company context -

## Conversation with Vest-AI

You can reply to a review comment made by this action and get a response based
on the diff context. Additionally, you can invite the bot to a conversation by
tagging it in the comment (`@vest-ai`).

Example:

> @vest-ai Please generate a test plan for this file.

Note: A review comment is a comment made on a diff or a file in the pull
request.

### Ignoring PRs

Sometimes it is useful to ignore a PR. For example, if you are using this action
to review documentation, you can ignore PRs that only change the documentation.
To ignore a PR, add the following keyword in the PR description:

```text
@vest-ai: ignore
```
